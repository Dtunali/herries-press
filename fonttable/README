    The fonttable package enables you to print a table of the characters
in a font (a font table), and/or some example text, and/or individual
glyphs in a variety of settings.

    This, in a package form, is a poor man's version of nfssfont.tex and
testfont.tex.

    IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK THEM ON THE COMP.TEXT.TEX NEWSGROUP
AS I AM AWAY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.
