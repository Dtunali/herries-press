# The Herries Press Collection

This repository contains a collection of LaTeX packages originally written by
Peter Wilson. These packages are now maintained by Will Robertson, who hopes
that they won't require too much upkeep.

Please direct all bug reports and feature requests to the [GitHub issue tracker][1].

I don't have time to actively develop all of the packages here; if you think
you would do a better job on any particular package (especially the larger
ones such as `xtab`), feel free to request maintainership for yourself.

The packages in this repository are:

 - [abstract](http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/abstract)
