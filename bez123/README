    LaTeX can be used for drawing quadratic Bezier curves. The bez123 
package provides additional facilities for drawing linear, cubic, and
rational quadratic Bezier curves. The multiply package provides a
command for multiplication of a length without numerical overflow.

README (this file)
bez123.dtx
bez123.ins
bez123.pdf
  and the derived files:
bez123.sty
multiply.sty

----------------------------------------------------------------- 

    To install the package:
o run: latex bez123.ins (which will generate bez123.sty and multiply.sty)
o Move bez123.sty and multiply.sty to a location where LaTeX will find them
  (typically in a local texmf tree at tex/latex/bez123) and refresh the
  file database. See the FAQ on CTAN at help/uk-tex-faq or
  http://www.tug.ac.uk/faq for more information on this.
    To process the manual:
o run: latex bez123.dtx (Note that bez123.dtx requires bez123.sty.
                         Several Package Warning messages will occur, but
                         these can be ignored.)
o run: makeindex -s gind.ist bez123
o run: latex bez123.dtx
o Print bez123.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual
