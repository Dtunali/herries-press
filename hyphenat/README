    The hyphenat package can be used to disable all hyphenation
in a document or in selected text within the document. It also 
enables hyphenation within `words' that contain analphabetic 
characters (e.g., that include underscores), and hyphenation of
text typeset in monospaced (e.g., CM typewriter) fonts.

Changes in version 2.3a
o Fixed a double hyphenation problem with some non-CM fonts.

Changes in version 2.3
o Added \hyp command for hyphenation of compound hyphenated words.
