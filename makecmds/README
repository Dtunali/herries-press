    The makecmds package provides several additional commands along
the lines of the traditional \(new|renew|provide)command and friends.
The new \makecommand{\foo}...} is equivalent to the pair of commands
\providecommand{\foo}{}\renewcommand{\foo}...}. There are also
\make... for environments, counters and lengths, and \provide...
for environments, lengths and counters.

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
makecmds.dtx
makecmds.ins

    The distribution is provided under the terms of the LaTeX
Project Public License (LPPL).

    To install the class:
- run: latex makecmds.ins (which will generate makecmds.sty)
- run: latex makecmds.dtx
- For an index, run: makeindex -s gind.ist makecmds
- run: latex makecmds.dtx
- Print makecmds.dvi for a hardcopy of the user manual 
- Move makecmds.sty to a location where LaTeX will find it.
